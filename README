NAME
    PSGI::OR::CGI - Write a PSGI app that also runs as CGI

VERSION
    $Id: README,v 0.1 2010/09/09 07:31:27 dankogai Exp dankogai $

SYNOPSIS
      #!/usr/bin/env perl
      # printenv.(psgi|cgi)
      use strict;
      use warnings;
      use Data::Dumper;
      use PSGI::OR::CGI;
  
      my $app = sub {
        my $env = shift;
        return [ 200, [ 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain' ], [ Dumper($env) ] ];
      };
  
      PSGI::OR::CGI->run($app);

EXPORT
    None.

METHODS
  PSGI::OR::CGI->run($app)
    If CGI, prints response accordingly to PSGI. If PSGI, immediately
    returns $app

    It checks the presense of $ENV{GATEWAY_INTERFACE} to check if the script
    is invoked as PSGI or CGI (or mod_perl Registry which also sets this
    environment variable).
